# Overview

This repository hosts my personal solutions to assignments from
[CS61A](https://cs61a.org).

I am following the Fall 2024 iteration of the course using two mirrored resources:

- A [website archive](https://github.com/InsideEmpire/CS61A-Website-Archive) of the Fall 2024 offering.
- A corresponding [assignments repository](https://github.com/InsideEmpire/CS61A-Assignments).

These resources are unofficial mirrors preserved for educational purposes.

## About the course ##

CS61A is part of a series (CS61) taught at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) as an introduction to computer science.

From the course syllabus:

"In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for managing program complexity, such as functional programming and object-oriented programming."

## Environment ##

* Interpreter: Python 3.13
* Editor: GNU Emacs

## Progress ##

- Week 01: welcome, functions
  - [x] Disc 00
  - [x] Lab 00 (in progress)
